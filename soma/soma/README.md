# SOMA
Simple OwnCloud Based Management of Associations

## Short Description
SOMA tries to implement soma Web based tool(s) for the administration of small,
closed groups of people (e.g. small private associations).

In a first approach, those tools shall be based on VPNs (one VPN per
association) that will ensure privacy of the communication.

The first tool will be the "Open Source Conferencing Tool" that has been defined
as the goal of [Phase 1 of S&P-ARK](https://github.com/christoph-v/spark).

One possibility to test the SOMA tools, will be the
[SOMA Test Web Site](https://lc-soc-lc.at/soma).
