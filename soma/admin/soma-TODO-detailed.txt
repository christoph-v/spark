DON- Ensure ownCloud(vServer) can send E-Mails
ONG- Some Security Issues at vServer
ONG- Ensure ownCloud(vServer) can use the local passwd file (FTP?)
   - Implement some rules about directories
      - for ownCloud users (each gets a "private" directory)
      - for members of "The Society" (have an only-members "public" directory)
   - Automated installation of the "Tiny VPN"
   - First Experiments with AJAX and Node.js (CORS)
   - Intended architecture for "simple AJAX login server based on Node.js"
      - the login server will be accessed via and located within a secure VPN
        (no additional encryption will be necessary, but that of the VPN)
      - the "external protocol" (i.e. ownCloud) provides a "user name" and an
        "access token" to the user. This user name + access token authorizes
        the user to download data from the login server
      - the user can download
         - authorization for a set of RTP sessions within the VPN
         - authorization for a set of roles the user may attain
         - authorization for using one of a set of avatars (coupled to roles)
         - and so on
