Betreff: [x3d-public] Semantics of X3D Work. How do these 
                      operators/verbs/actions/predicates fit into the X3D ontology?

Predicates for Work: (Christoph, read last line of email)


Prototype/Design/Storyboard
Act/Perform/Operate
Build/Script/Develop
Research and Brainstorm
Prepare/Plan/Train
Direct/Desire/Specify/Select/Goal Set/Target
Strategize
Discuss/Trade/Network/Meet (related to Input/Output from previous email)
Handle/Delegate

I’ll call this 90’s and 00’s thinking “my work generation”

I’m looking for an ontology for work, in particular the top level predicates or
verbs that all work verbs are a subclass of. For example, much of this came out
of the military’s ontology namely:

Operations
Logistics
Tactics
Strategy

I’ll call the latter “70’s thinking.”  I was introduced to it in the late 80’s though


What is the process or system behind X3D? What is 10’s thinking? What is 20’s
thinking? Do we dare ontologize our work?

If you look into the 70’s thinking, you can see why AI was focused on Scripts
and Goals. Now that we’re “agile,” what verbs do we use to describe work?
Collaborate? Is that the top level predicate? How is this reflected in computer
science research on semantics?

Would it be useful to look at a Thesaurus?   I feel like an old geezer bringing
up ancient technology.

If we’re creating 3D virtual worlds, why not create a virtual world we can work
in?  Can I buy an office “at” Amazon? How might “buying an office” invert the
work world? Can I invest in virtual offices?

Do we need a X3D work working group under the semantic group? “X3D in the
working world”

What difficulties might be faced bringing our work into virtual reality or
augmented reality?   What can we help with?  Or do we need to bring computers
out of their fancy boxes, ala dynamicland?   What is this thing we don’t use
to program, the webcam?  Here are 2 more verbs we might use in the 20’s:

Capture (beyond motion capture, capturing intent)
Project

Gamers already have this cold.

Where is Second Life and Open Croquet these days?   What can we learn from them
to not repeat?  How do we enable 3D in work?

So 3 predicates, Capture, Collaborate, Project (Capture/Project is I/O).
Others?

What does Collaborate look like?  Is it more I/O? Is it more than just humans
now?  How does a chat bot ask questions of me?

How do we input and output collaborations?  Git and SVN?  Can we duplicate
Git’s success for other professsions?  Is anyone using git to store virtual
worlds? Michaelis?

Is there a concept of capturing a collaboration in a virtual world?
What file format is this?  Christoph?
