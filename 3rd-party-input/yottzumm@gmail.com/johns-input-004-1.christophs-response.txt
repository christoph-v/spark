John,

I am not a scientist. I am a simple telco programmer, who's done a few
considerations about virtual universes during a hobby project.

Anyway, I will do my best.

>>>>>>>>>> Is there a concept of capturing a collaboration in a virtual world?
What file format is this?  Christoph?

Collaboration is an activity that is done by subjects. You can store logs about
a collaboration, but a collaboration per se is not a file format, as far as I
think to understand.

For virtual universes, I see three levels of collaboration.
 
1) Collaborating on the construction of Composite Scenes.

   We need some BCPs about how to make scenes from components (i.e. from
   geographic infrastructure, avatars, models, modules, ......)

   Each component can be sourced by a different project/repository. File format
   is any Web3D format (vrml, x3d, ......)

   Maybe some tools will be needed to "compile" composite scenes from components.

   Some community could virtually gather every now and then to "put the
   components together for on-line collaboration (3)"

2) Collaborating on one component

   Standard git / svn / ..... procedures

3) on-line collaboration

   N users collaborate in a multiuser scene to

      - add/remove objects to/from the scene during runtime
      - change the network state of objects
      - send network events to objects
      - and so on

(1) and (2) would use x3d / vrml / ...... file format
(3) format of network states and events tbd.

All the best
Christoph
