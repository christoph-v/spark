The thing is, the competition will be in the open…I can always open the main
scene in source-mode to see which other inlines I am competing with, copy their
networking code if it’s open source, etc.  I guess we need to allocate a space
for each inline in the main scene, perhaps with Transforms. Then we will have
to limit the Inline to consume a certain space. Hmm seems like some work.

    SP-ARK is dedicated to the use (and support) of X3Dv4 [ USE, SUPPORT ]
    2) basically, the playground is open to anybody, who is interested in simple
       multiuser scenes [ INTEREST, FOCUS ]
    3) probably we will implement some demo application maybe even a server
       (depends on support) [ IMPLEMENT ]
    4) Goal 1: help the Web3D Consortium in defining an application layer
       protocol for the Network Sensor [ DEFINE ]


    8) SP-ARK has not been started yet, but with this e-mail the probability of
       a start increases :-)  [ START ]


I am suggesting if we use GitHub, we may not even need a centralized server.
Users may upload a “peer repo id” to GitHub main repo (using pull requests for
access control) and each X3D client of a scene may use an Inline to load the
peer repo id’s scenes, found by searching for .x3d, … etc under the peer repo id.
Can we use the SP-ARK repo as the main repo, and do you have a URL for loading
the main scene into my browser?  Thanks!

Then each Inline will support different styles of application layer networking
per their author, and may the best party be successfully in connecting with
everyone else! Anyone want to start a corewar game?

What will be the javascript includes on the main scene?

John.

John,

Of course I will add these ideas to the collection of inputs.
