Betreff: RE: [x3d-public] SP-ARK - ready to start

Perhaps you can get some inspiration from my multiuser tag, cards, and chat program:

https://quiet-forest-75069.herokuapp.com
https://github.com/coderextreme/pc.multiplayer

I have patched the high vulnerabilities in this, but a moderate one still exists in node-rest-client (the rest of the vulnerabilities are in dev code). The suggestion is to switch to axios, but I don’t see as axios provides for $ variable substitution.  It looks like node-rest-client won’t be fixed, so if you want to contribute a patch to my code which installs axios (I think the rest code is in app.js), that would be most welcome.   Node-rest-client is not vital to the running of app.js, and the metaServer code may be removed.  However, it’s nice to keep track of all the servers running.
I am not currently prepared to start on another multiuser project right now.
One thing that could be done is add a X3DOM or X_ITE front end.
There’s  a basic protocol sitting on top of socket.io there.  Reviews of the protocol are welcome, but not returned in kind!

Good luck with SP-ARK!

Subject: [x3d-public] SP-ARK - ready to start

Dear all
The repository of the SP-ARK project has received some updates during the last one and a half year. All this can be described by the metaphor of “loading some fusibles into an oven, where the fire can be ignited”.
Now, when we have provisioned the first three text files of “THE BRAINSTORMING”, then it is possible to start THE SP-ARK PROJECT.
It’s up to you to contribute or not. It’s your stuff.

Have fun,
Christoph
