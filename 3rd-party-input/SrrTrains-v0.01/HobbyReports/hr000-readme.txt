                    ================================
                    
                                                                      2019-08-15     

================================================================================
The SrrTrains v0.01 project is currently being in a "CLOSED" state, because we
are waiting for 3rd party interest to RE-OPEN the project.
================================================================================

================================================================================
The stable version of the Hobby Reports of SrrTrains v0.01 that were in line
with the release 0033.10 "Pieta" of the SRR Framework - i.e. the version 3.x of
the Hobby Reports - can be found in branch "stable_33.10".

The current stable version of the SRR Framework (step 0033.10.5 "Fiat A Base")
can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/simulrr/files/

Step 0033.10.5 is currently documented in the master branch. The documentation
for step 0033.10.5 is not stable yet.
================================================================================

================================================================================
The Hobby Reports are now being provided for version 4.x (which should provide a
view to the "Fiat A" release (step 0033.10.5), to the "Arimathea" release (step
0033.11) and to the "Sabbath" release (step 0033.12 = step 0033) as they are
currently envisioned) in the "master" branch of the present repository.

    - items to be part of "Fiat A" are not marked
    - items to be done for "Arimathea" are marked by a tag "TODO11"
    - items to be done for "Sabbath" are marked by a tag "TODO12"
    - items to be done even later (step >= 0034) are marked by a tag "TODO"

Prophecy i.e. Planning: 
    - "Fiat A" will be finished "not before 2020, if at all"
    - TODO11 "Arimathea" will be finished "beyond 2020, if at all"
    - TODO12 "tbd." will be finished "even later, if at all"

Everything marked by "TODO" is currently "OPEN" (not planned)
================================================================================

Envisioned steps 0034, 0035, ..... of the SrrTrains project might be considered
in SrrTrains v1.0, which might become existent, if the SMS Biotope will become
existent as an outcome of SP-ARK.
