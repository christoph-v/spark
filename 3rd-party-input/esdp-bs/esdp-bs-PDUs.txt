1  Scope of the Text
--------------------
The following text is written in a spirit of trying to inspire ideas about a
future application layer protocol for X3D multiuser scenes.

Abbreviations:
PDU	......Protocol Data Unit – a well defined piece of information that can be
          piggy backed on the back of some lower layer protocols
Login Server ......a server that has the knowledge of how to handle the creden-
                   tials of a user
Server [Hierarchy] .......a server or a hierarchy of servers that can collect
                          requests from scene instances and distribute notifi-
                          cations about state change to all scene instances of
                          a multiuser session

2 Some Draft Considerations about PDUs of "Protocol X"
------------------------------------------------------

LI-R / LI-CH / LI-G
-------------------
Login Request: A PDU, which is sent from one scene instance to the login server
               that is responsible for the user, who wants to login at this
               scene instance
Login Challenge: A Login Request may invoke a Login Challenge, which is sent
                 back to the scene instance in order to proceed with the
                 authentication and authorization procedure for this user.
                 When the scene instance receives the Login Challenge, it must
                 send another Login Request with the final credentials
Login Grant: The Login Request with the final credentials invokes a Login Grant
             which is sent back to the scene instance. Now the scene instance
             grants access to the user and authorizes actions according to the
             user profile

SPRE, SUN
---------
State Publish Request: A PDU, which is sent from one scene instance to the
"Reset State"          server [hierarchy] or to the scene instance, which owns
                       the controller role for the stream (Network Sensor) in
                       question

                       invoked by set_<state> event(s) at the interface of the
                       Network Sensor or by similar means of similar SW objects

                       At the server [hierarchy] or at the controller instance,
                       this PDU invokes a SUN PDU with the new values of all
                       states that have been reset
         
State Update Notification: A PDU, which is sent by the server [hierarchy] or by
"Change State"             the controller instance of the stream to all scene
                           instances that have subscribed to the stream or to
                           all scene instances
                           
                           It contains the new or current value (if the value
                           has not been updated) of some or all states of a 
                           stream 
                           
                           it invokes the <state>_changed event(s) at the
                           interface of the network sensor or some similar
                           means of similar SW objects
                       
SCR
---
State Change Request: A PDU, which is sent from one scene instance to the server
"Server Side Calculations"  [hierarchy] or to the scene instance that owns the
                            controller role for the sream (Network Sensor) in
                            question
                            
                      It indicates for each affected state a required operation
                      and the required parameter value for the operation

                      invoked by add_<state>, inc_<state>, ...... or similar
                      event(s) at the interface of the Network Sensor or by
                      similar means of similar SW objects

                      At the server [hierarchy] or at the controller instance,
                      this PDU invokes a SUN PDU with the new values of all
                      states that have been part of the SCR.

BEV, REV
--------
Broadcast Event: A PDU, which is sent
"Event Distribution"   a) from one scene instance to the server [hierarchy] and
                          then to all scene instances that have subscribed to
                          the stream or to all scene instances
                       b) from one scene instance to all scene instances
                 
                 it is invoked by evt_<event> and it invokes <event>_evt at the
                 interface of the Network Sensor or at similar means of similar
                 SW objects

Route Event: A PDU, which is routed from one scene instance to the scene
"Client Side Calculations"     instance that owns the controller role for the
                               stream (Network Sensor)

STS
---
Subscribe to Stream: A PDU, which is sent by a Scene Instance that wants to
                     initialize one or more Network Sensors

SPQR
----
State Purge and Query Request: A special PDU to annihilate the value of states
at the server
                               
Note
----
The controller role is a state like any other, it is an SFInt32, which holds the
sessionId of the scene instance that owns the controller role
