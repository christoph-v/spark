Follows some questions / inspirations from John C. and the answers (tbd.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What will be the use case of the demo application?

A: 1. The demo application will focus on "Collaborating" - we follow John's
      explanation that "collaborating" is rather the activity done by the
      subjects and "collaboration" is rather the result of the "collaborating"

   2. Basically, following levels of "Collaborating" will be available

      2.a. Collaborating on the Creation of the Demo Application
            - Defining the Game
            - Implementing the Game (simple tools - text editor a.s.o.)
            - Using / Testing the Game / Having lots of fun
            - Defining the "lower layers" that can be re-used by other projects
                 or even standardized (this is the "goal")
           
           The result of this "collaborating" will be a file hierarchy stored
           at github.com/christoph-v/spark

      2.b. Collaborating on the Creation of "Extended Universe" (later, not yet)
            - Doing your own projects (Games, Collaborative Apps., ...)
            - Using / Testing the common "lower layers" -> feed back to SP-ARK
            - Creating your own extensions of the common "lower layers"
            
            This "collaborating" is out of scope currently

      2.c. Professional Support for the "Extended Universe" (even later)
            - Providing / Customizing authoring tools for the "EU"
            - Providing / Customizing server software for the "EU"
            - Providing / Customizing professional extensions of the common
              "lower layers"

            This "collaborating" is out of scope currently

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What will be the content of the scene (Avatars, Models, ......)? What is a
   "collaboration"? Which "collaborations" will we implement?

A: This question deals with another level of "collaborating", i.e. with the
   "on-line collaborating" within the multiuser scene.
   
   This question cannot generally be answered. Our use case could be as simple
   as a 3D chat, where every user has the ability to create his own worlds and
   to virtually meet and chat, showing his friends the own achievements, or it
   can be as complex as a railway simulation that is connected to a real life
   model railroad.
   
   Our approach is the approach of an extensible standard. The absolute minimum
   shall be elaborated, which must be commonly (and freely) available for all
   kinds of "Simple Multiuser Scenes", where programmers shall have the
   possibility to extend the commonly available by their own extensions.
   This shall be open to many kinds of business cases, even to business cases
   that need to provide closed software for an extension to economically "work".

Q: What is a "shared state"?
   Note that I have difficulty talking about state because of multiple meanings,
   political, physics etc. Do you really just mean state, state of what?  What
   does the state transition network look like?
A: This is a technical detail, which should be answered as an OUTPUT of SP-ARK,
   but which is not an INPUT to SP-ARK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How to apply the pub/sub pattern to our case? Which values to transmit?
   Even objects? Files? Videos? What are the "topics"?
A: This is a technical detail, which should be answered as an OUTPUT of SP-ARK,
   but which is not an INPUT to SP-ARK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What content are we designing in to our messages?   What do we require of the
   underlying system beside transport? Multimedia? In-order messages? Signaling?
A: This is a technical detail, which should be answered as an OUTPUT of SP-ARK,
   but which is not an INPUT to SP-ARK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I would rather discuss the HLAP (High Level Application Protocol), and let
   the HLAP choose a software infrastructure based on requirements of the HLAP
   (That is, set requirements for the lower level protocols). Once we have a
   shopping list of requirements, we go shopping for something compatible with
   Web3D’s Intellectual Property rules.
   Requirements of a transport for HLAP:
    Many to Many topics and messaging capable of carrying or referring to X3D
          multimedia, Avatars, Inventory and Communication.
          At up to ?? messages per second
    Federated messaging (possibly spatiotemporal)
    Conferences/Rooms/Channels/Topics for private X3D worlds
    Block a publisher
    Report a publisher
    Message log/replay.
    Edit own messages.
    Conference/Topic/Room/Channel search?
    Usable from HTML5 web.
   Please provide input for this list.
A: This is a technical detail, which should be answered as an OUTPUT of SP-ARK,
   but which is not an INPUT to SP-ARK.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Which functions do we delegate to the transport protocol? (voice, IM, ......)
A: This is a technical detail, which should be answered as an OUTPUT of SP-ARK,
   but which is not an INPUT to SP-ARK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What are the "master rules"?
A: 1) SP-ARK is dedicated to the use (and support) of X3Dv4
   2) basically, the playground is open to anybody, who is interested in simple
      multiuser scenes
   3) probably we will implement some demo application maybe even a server
      (depends on support)
   4) Goal 1: help the Web3D Consortium in defining an application layer
              protocol for the Network Sensor
   5) SP-ARK has not been started yet, but with this e-mail the probability of a
      start increases :-)
