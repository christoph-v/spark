## 2. Everlasting Statements (last modified on 2019-04-13)

### 2.1. The GOALs of this project can be described as follows

- Develop a Demo Simple Multiuser Scene*) with Working Title "Spaceship Web3D"
- SMS-BONES-GPS: Support Standardization of Network Sensor Node (NSN) **)
- Hence igniting what-I-call SMS Biotope or Extended Universe (Working Title)

 *)
A Simple Multiuser Scene is an X3Dv4 ***) MU Scene, which uses standardized
communication protocols to communicate among scene instances and with a server.
It uses the X3D Network Sensor Node as one of its nodes to access the network

**)
The Network Sensor Node (NSN) was proposed some time ago. It enables the scene
author to define fields with arbitrary names (similar to Script or Prototype
nodes). Those fields can be used to send and receive the current value or change
requests for some network events and for some network states. Pre-defined
calculations can be used on the server side and client side calculations can be
autonomously implemented by the scene author to calculate the current value of
states and events.

The exact syntax and the protocol for the Network Sensor are still to be
defined. SP-ARK shall help to gain knowledge about the possibilities we have
therefore.

***)
X3Dv4 is version 4 of the "Extensible 3D" standard, which is developed at
http://www.web3d.org.

****)
The acronym SMS-BONES-GPS means, we would like to support the idea of
using and/or profiling and/or defining IETF based communication protocols for
Mixed Reality multiuser scenes
i.e. the goal is to support something we would denote as
- Simple Multiuser Scenes - Based On Network Sensor - Global Protocol Spec
      
### 2.2. The content of this repository is licensed by a GPL 

## 3. Other Statements

### Statement on 2018-12-30 by https://github.com/christoph-v

As long as nobody else volunteers to host the SP-ARK project, I will
host a PRELIMINARY homepage at my "Area #A" blog:
https://areasharpa.wordpress.com/spark

### Statement on 2017-12-02 by https://github.com/christoph-v

In a first approach, I will bring the documentation of SrrTrains v0.01 project
(.odt) to this repository to have it properly licensed
