# SOMA
Simple ClOud Based Management of Associations

## Short Description
SOMA tries to implement some Web based tool(s) for the administration of small,
closed groups of people (e.g. small private associations).

In a first approach, those tools shall be based on VPNs (one VPN per
association) that will ensure privacy of the communication.

The first tool will be the "Open Source Conferencing Tool" that has been defined
as the goal of [Phase 1 of S&P-ARK](https://github.com/christoph-v/spark).

However, the directory spark/ALPES/apps/soma/ does contain outdated information,
currently, and the "Open Source Conferencing Tool", which I call now OSC/AR,
will be implemented in the directory spark/ALPES/apps/osc_ar/.

The "Application Router", which will be needed by OSC/AR, will be implemented
in the directory spark/ALPES/servs/ar/.

Yours Christoph
