# The Teapot Review

The Teapot Review is an X3D Multiuser Scene, which is currently based on the
DIS protocol.

Currently, I am using this scene to test the FreeWrl DIS implementation, in the
course of my project
[Experiments with FreeWrl and DIS over the TVI](https://lc-soc-lc.or.at/project-003-dexper/index.html).

That project is not actually connected to the DIGITS / S&P-ARK / ALPES project,
but I decided to store the "Teapot Review" here at the spark repository, in
order to be able to collaborate with other authors.
