# Application Layer Protocol, Experimental Setup (ALPES)

NOTE ON FRIDAY, MAY 10th, 2024: The DIGITS / S&P - ARK / ALPES project is
currently having very slow progress. The founding of our organizational
infrastructure, the so-called **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"**,
took precedence over the actual ALPES project.

The **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"** can now be found on the Internet
domain [lc-soc-lc.or.at](https://lc-soc-lc.or.at)

Also, we are doing some experiments with the DIS protocol, currently, which are
not actually connected to the ALPES project.

So, the ALPES project is currently lower prioritized, while we try to establish
some reliable infrastructure for all these activities.
