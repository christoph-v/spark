# Application Layer Protocol, Experimental Setup (ALPES)

The Experimental Setup is installed at our vServer [https://lc-soc-lc.at/addendum.htm](https://lc-soc-lc.at/addendum.htm).

There we use the infrastructure of the **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"**,
which is currently provided by our Webmaster ben-yeti.

**"The Society"** has not yet been founded, but we are confident that we'll
find some interest to join us in the future.

The Experimental Setup intends to implement a few APPs, which will be based on
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The APPs will use the **"Experimental Login Server Application (ELSA)"** to be
able to authorize the used multimedia peer connections (which will be WebRTC 
based).

The first APP will be the **"Simple OwnCloud based Management of Associations"**
APP (SOMA).
