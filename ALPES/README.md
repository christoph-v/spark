# Application Layer Protocol, Experimental Setup (ALPES)

NOTE ON SATURDAY, MAY 11th, 2024: The DIGITS / S&P - ARK / ALPES project is
currently having very slow progress. The founding of our organizational
infrastructure, the so-called **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"**,
took precedence over the actual ALPES project.

The **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"** can now be found on the Internet
domain [lc-soc-lc.or.at](https://lc-soc-lc.or.at)

Also, I was doing some experiments with the DIS protocol, which were not
actually connected to the ALPES project.

So, the ALPES project is currently lower prioritized, while we try to establish
some reliable infrastructure for all these activities.

The "Open Source Conferencing Tool" (see directory spark/ALPES/apps/osc_ar) is
our current focus here on the S&P-ARK.
