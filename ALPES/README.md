# Application Layer Protocol, Experimental Setup (ALPES)

## NOTE ON SATURDAY, MAY 11th, 2024

The DIGITS/S&P-ARK/ALPES project is currently having very slow progress. The
founding of our organizational infrastructure, the so-called **"Society for
Lifelong Collaborating"**, took precedence over the actual ALPES project.

A few results of our endeavors to implement the SOMA (Simple ClOud Based
Management of Associations) can be found in the directory
[spark/ALPES/apps/soma](https://github.com/christoph-v/spark/tree/master/ALPES/apps/soma))

## Status on Saturday, March 29th, 2025

The **"Society for Lifelong Collaborating"** can now be found on the Internet
domain [lc-soc-lc.or.at (external link)](https://lc-soc-lc.or.at).

Also, I was doing some experiments with the DIS protocol, which were not
actually connected to the ALPES project.

So, the ALPES project was being lower prioritized for some time, while we were
trying to establish some reliable infrastructure for all these activities.

NOW, the "Open Source Conferencing Tool" (see the directory
[spark/ALPES/apps/osc_ar](https://github.com/christoph-v/spark/tree/master/ALPES/apps/osc_ar))
is our current focus here on the S&P-ARK/ALPES project.

This can be interpreted as a preparation for the "real" start of the
S&P-ARK/ALPES project, which will not be started before the year 2030.
